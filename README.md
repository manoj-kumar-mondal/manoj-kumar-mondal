# 👋 Hi, I'm Manoj Kumar Mondal
---
**Embedded Software Engineer | RTOS | ARM architecture & trustzone | Embedded Security | Secure Embedded Systems**

Passionate about exploring how hardware and software interact at the lowest level. Each steps toward understanding systems more deeply from how a processor boots to how secure firmware runs reliably under constraints.


## 🔭 Current Focus
Currently exploring the deeper side of embedded systems, where firmware meets operating systems and security meets performance.  

- 🧩 [mkernel](https://github.com/manoj-kumar-mondal/mkernel): A custom RTOS from scratch to understand how scheduling, synchronization, and memory management work at the core.
- ⚙️ Strengthening low-level firmware design through real-world STM32 and ARM cortex M based projects.
- 🔐 Experimenting with secure firmware concepts like TrustZone and verified boot mechanisms.
- 🔎 Exploring memory allocators, stack behavior, and system-level debugging and how kernel concepts translate to embedded and real-time environments.

Continuing the journey toward mastering system-level development -> aiming to design and contribute to embedded systems that are secure, efficient, and meaningful for the community.

## 💡 What Drives Me  
- A deep curiosity to understand how systems truly work from the first instruction that powers a processor to the final line of firmware that makes a device come alive is what drives this journey.
- The focus is not just on writing code, but on contributing expertise that can help design smarter, safer, and more efficient technologies.
- Solving complex embedded and system-level challenges feels meaningful when it transforms intricate hardware-software interactions into something reliable and useful for world.

## 🏗️ Featured Projects
- 🔸 **Custom RTOS Development**
    - A lightweight experimental operating system project aimed at learning and implementing the core building blocks of a kernel starting from memory management and expanding toward process handling, scheduling, synchronizing processes and system-level services. [mkernel](https://github.com/manoj-kumar-mondal/mkernel)
  
- 🔸 **Crash Dump Analysis Tool** *(Integrated these mechanisms in ongoing projects to improve fault traceability, reduce debugging time)*
    -  Developed a crash dump collection and analysis framework to investigate unexpected faults for ARM cortex M.
    -  During exceptions or hard faults, the system captures complete core context including data from **general-purpose registers, stack pointer (SP), link register (LR), program counter (PC), and program status register (xPSR)**.
    -  This captured dump is then parsed and analyzed to identify the root cause of failures or abnormal firmware behavior.

- 🔸 **Secure Firmware Installtion and Upgrade System**  *(Key concepts from this design are now part of production firmware to strengthen the security chain in embedded systems.)* 
    - Developed Bootloader + App system with image verification, rollback prevention, and integrity checks.
    - Designed a secure firmware installation and update mechanism to ensure firmware integrity and authenticity during production and deployment.    
    - The process ensures **firmware validation through cryptographic hash calculation and digital signature verification**, following proper authentication procedures to maintain a trusted and secure firmware environment.

- 🔸 **Dynamic Memory Manager**  
  A lightweight memory allocation system using static buffer management for embedded devices. [dynamic_memory_managment](https://github.com/manoj-kumar-mondal/dynamic_memory_managment)
